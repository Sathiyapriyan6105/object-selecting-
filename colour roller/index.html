        Manual rollers are the most common type of paint roller. These rollers are typically used to apply paint to walls and ceilings and,
         as such, have handles that feature connectors for handle extensions. Because of the length of their handles, manual rollers are particularly 
         useful in painting high surfaces. In fact, if the handle is long enough, you can paint a ceiling with a manual roller without having to use a ladder. 
         One potential drawback to this type of roller is that it tends to produce a fair amount of paint drips if even a little too much paint is applied.
