        Metal might not be the flashiest material in packaging these days, and likely hasnâ€™t been since the 1920s,
        but it remains an essential product for both manufactures and consumers. Think about the last time you filled a vehicle with gas,
        purchased paint or went to a ball game. Metal containers are involved in our lives almost every day because many of their qualities cannot be found in other materials.
