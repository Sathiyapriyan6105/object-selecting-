        A color chart or color reference card is a flat, physical object that has many different color samples present. 
        They can be available as a single-page chart, or in the form of swatchbooks or color-matching fans.<br>
        Typically there are two different types of color charts:<br>

        <b>Color reference charts </b>are intended for color comparisons and measurements. Typical tasks for such charts are checking the color reproduction of an imaging system, aiding in color management or visually determining the hue of color. Examples are the IT8 and ColorChecker charts.<br>
        <b>Color selection charts</b> present a palette of available colors to aid the selection of spot colors, process colors, paints, pens, crayons, and so on â€“ usually the colors are from a manufacturers product range. Examples are the Pantone and RAL systems.<br>
        Color reference charts are used for color comparisons and measurements such as checking the color reproduction of an imaging system, and calibration and/or profiling of digital input devices such as digital cameras, and scanners and output display systems like printers, monitors and projectors. <br>
        They are also used by traditional photographers and cinematographers to calibrate cameras that use film and to check the color temperature of the lighting.
